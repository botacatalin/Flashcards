# Overview
Flashcard Builder is a two‑part tool: the builder lets you design two‑sided flashcards with layouts, text, and images, then exports the card metadata as JSON, while the presenter loads that JSON to display the flashcards in a polished flip‑card viewer.

The application has two components
- The Builder lets you create flashcard content.
- The Presenter lets you view that content.

# Builder includes two main areas:
- Configuration area – used to define general settings such as the flashcard layout and card name.
- Preview area – where you customize and visualize the front and back of the flashcard.
- Exporting the flashcard data is done in a json format that can be later imported in the presenter.
